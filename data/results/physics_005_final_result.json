Solver_1's refined solution stood out due to its detailed explanation, clear step-by-step breakdown of the unit conversion process, and ensuring consistency in the units used to present the final answer. This not only addressed the problem accurately but also enhanced the educational value of the solution. While Solver_2 and Solver_3 also provided correct solutions, Solver_1's approach to refining their solution and the clarity of their explanation gave them a slight edge in terms of reasoning quality.",
