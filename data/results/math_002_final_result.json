The refined solution of Solver_3 corrected an initial oversight, making it even more precise. The binary search method proposed in refined solutions by Solver_1 and Solver_2, and their incorrect final answers, demonstrate a misunderstanding of how to accurately calculate the number of trailing zeros in a factorial. Solver_3's approach, both original and refined, is methodologically sound and correctly identifies the smallest n that results in exactly 100 trailing zeros.",
