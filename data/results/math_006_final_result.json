Solver_3, however, provided the most comprehensive and concise explanation, particularly in their refined solution. They not only addressed the problem for natural numbers but also expanded on the function's behavior over non-integer real numbers, thus offering a more thorough understanding of the function's linearity across its entire domain. This additional insight, along with a clear and direct approach to explaining the solution, sets Solver_3's solution apart.",
