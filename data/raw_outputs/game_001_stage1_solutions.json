To do this, we need to control the situation such that after our turn, the number of coins left in the pile is a multiple of 4. This is because no matter how many coins (1, 2, or 3) the other player takes on their turn, we can always take enough coins to make the pile a multiple of 4 again (If they take 3, we take 1. If they take 2, we take 2. If they take 1, we take 3).",
