Solver_1 initially identified a pure strategy Nash equilibrium but later revised their solution towards a mixed strategy without fully committing to the absence of a pure strategy. Solver_3's solutions suggested a misunderstanding of the Nash equilibrium concept by proposing multiple Nash equilibriums, including non-entry as an equilibrium, which contradicts the game's payoff structure. Solver_2 consistently recognized the absence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium and correctly focused on the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, demonstrating a deeper understanding of the game's dynamics.",
