          "Step 3: Understand that the location of the bright fringes on the screen can be found using the formula y = (m * lambda * L) / d, where y is the distance from the central maximum, m is the fringe order number, lambda is the wavelength of the light, L is the distance to the screen, and d is the slit separation distance.",
          "Step 4: Plug in the values to find the distance of the 3rd bright fringe (m=3) from the central maximum. Use lambda = 500 x 10^-9 m, L = 2 m, and d = 0.1 x 10^-3 m.",
          "Step 5: Correct the calculation y = (3 * 500 x 10^-9 m * 2 m) / (0.1 x 10^-3 m) = 0.03 m, which is the accurate distance of the 3rd bright fringe from the central maximum.",

        "improvement_explanation": "This refined solution corrects the previously made calculation error and maintains consistency with SI units by presenting the final answer in meters. The additional conversion to millimeters is retained for practical comprehension, which is beneficial in the context of the experiment. This approach addresses the critiques while justifying the practical rationale behind unit conversion for the final answer."
