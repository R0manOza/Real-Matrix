          "Step 3: Evaluate potential bids - Consider that bids above $100 result in a net loss, making them undesirable.",
          "Step 4: Factor in diverse valuations - Acknowledge that the other bidder might value the item differently, influencing their bid.",
          "Step 5: Consider a range of competitor strategies - Realize the other bidder might employ psychological pricing or bid based on unique valuations, affecting the optimal bid.",
          "Step 6: Optimize the bid - Determine a bid that maximizes the chance of winning at a value-positive price, considering the variability in the other bidder's strategy and valuation.",
          "Step 7: Implement psychological pricing cautiously - Recognize the potential for the other bidder to also use psychological pricing, making a bid of $98 or $99 potentially predictable.",
          "Step 8: Determine the refined bid - Choose a bid that is slightly below $100 but not necessarily predictable, such as $98.50, to balance the benefits of winning against the costs, while also accounting for a wider range of bidder behaviors and strategies."

        "improvement_explanation": "This version improves upon the original by addressing valid critiques about assumptions regarding the other bidder's valuation and strategy. It considers a broader range of potential behaviors and strategies from the other bidder, making the proposed bidding strategy more versatile and grounded in a more realistic appraisal of auction dynamics. By suggesting a bid that is not rounded to a whole number, it also subtly addresses and circumvents the predictability associated with psychological pricing tactics."
