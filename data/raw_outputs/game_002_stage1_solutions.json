You need to balance the desire to win the auction with the desire to pay as little as possible. Because you don't know the other bidder's maximum willingness to pay, a common strategy is to bid a little less than what the item is worth to you.",
        "Step 3: Choose your bid - Since the item is worth $100 to you, you could bid slightly less than this amount. This ensures that if you win, you're paying less than what the item is worth to you. However, you could risk losing the auction if the other bidder bids more than you. You need to weigh your desire to win against your desire to pay as little as possible."
