  "problem_text": "A block of mass 2 kg slides down a frictionless incline at 30° to the horizontal. At the bottom, it collides elastically with a stationary block of mass 4 kg on a horizontal surface. What is the final speed of the 2 kg block? (Assume g = 10 m/s² and the first block starts from rest at height 5 m)",

The refined solution improves on clarity and accessibility, making it the most comprehensive and understandable solution. Solver_1 also provided a correct solution, but Solver_3's explanation, especially regarding the 1:2 mass ratio shortcut and the clarification on speed versus velocity, made their solution stand out. Solver_2's refined solution incorrectly calculated the final speed of the 2 kg block as 5 m/s, which is not supported by the conservation laws as applied in this scenario.",

However, there was a discrepancy in Solver_2's interpretation in their refined solution, which led to a different and incorrect final answer.
