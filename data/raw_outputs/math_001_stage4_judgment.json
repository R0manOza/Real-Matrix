The peer reviews for solver_1's solution indicate a general agreement on its correctness, despite initial uncertainties. Solver_2 also arrived at the correct answer but had a misunderstanding in the original solution about the sequence alternating between 0 and non-zero values, which was corrected in the refined solution. However, solver_1's explanation was clearer and more logically sound. Solver_3's approach was initially too vague and lacked a concrete method for calculation, and although the refined solution improved by introducing a specific recursive formula, it still fell short of providing a definitive answer or a clear path to one.",
