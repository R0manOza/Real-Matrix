Solver_1's refined solution, however, stands out for its exceptionally clear and detailed explanation of the principles and formulas used, alongside a strong emphasis on unit consistency. This not only ensures correctness but also enhances educational value, making the solution more accessible and understandable for a broader audience. The peer reviews further support this choice, with all solvers receiving positive feedback on the correctness of their solutions but Solver_1 receiving particular praise for the clarity and thoroughness of their explanation.",
    "consensus_analysis": "There was a consensus among the solvers regarding the correctness of the solution, with all three arriving at the same final answer. The peer reviews were uniformly positive, highlighting the correctness and logical structure of each solution.
