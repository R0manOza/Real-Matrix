The potential energy at the top is given by PE = mgh, where m = 2 kg, g = 10 m/s^2, and h = 5 m. Thus, PE = 2 * 10 * 5 = 100 J.",
            "Step 2: The kinetic energy (KE) of the block at the bottom of the incline is equal to the potential energy at the top due to energy conservation in a frictionless system, so KE = 100 J. Since KE = 0.5 * m * v^2, we can solve for v: 100 = 0.5 * 2 * v^2, which simplifies to v^2 = 100, giving v = 10 m/s as the speed of the 2 kg block at the bottom of the incline.",
            "Step 3: When the 2 kg block collides elastically with the 4 kg block, both momentum and kinetic energy are conserved. The initial momentum of the system is the momentum of the 2 kg block, since the 4 kg block is initially stationary. The initial momentum is p = m * v = 2 kg * 10 m/s = 20 kg*m/s.",
            "Step 4: Let v1 be the final velocity of the 2 kg block and v2 the final velocity of the 4 kg block after the collision. Conservation of momentum gives us the equation: 2 * 10 = 2 * v1 + 4 * v2.",
            "Step 5: For an elastic collision, kinetic energy is also conserved. The initial kinetic energy is given by 0.5 * 2 * 10^2 = 100 J. The final kinetic energy is 0.5 * 2 * v1^2 + 0.5 * 4 * v2^2. Setting the initial kinetic energy equal to the final kinetic energy gives us another equation to solve simultaneously with the momentum conservation equation.",
            "Step 6: Solving the two equations from steps 4 and 5 simultaneously requires some algebra. However, a shortcut in the case of a 1:2 mass ratio in an elastic collision can be used: the lighter mass reverses its velocity, and the heavier mass takes on the velocity of the lighter one pre-collision. This phenomenon is a result of the conservation laws and the specific mass ratio. Thus, v1 = -10 m/s (indicating a reversal) and v2 = 10 m/s.",
            "Step 7: However, the question asks for the final speed of the 2 kg block, not its velocity. Speed is the magnitude of velocity, so the final speed of the 2 kg block is 10 m/s."
